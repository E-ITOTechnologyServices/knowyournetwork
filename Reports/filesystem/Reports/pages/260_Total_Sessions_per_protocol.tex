\chapter[Total Sessions per Protocol]{\underline{Total Sessions per Protocol}}
\begin{flushleft}
The next table shows the analyzed sessions per protocol. This statistic provides information about the protocol mixture in the network. Depending on the use of certain networks the ratio of UDP and TCP varies and a certain amount of ICMP is very normal as ICMP is not only used for monitoring purposes but also for MTU or next hop discovery.
