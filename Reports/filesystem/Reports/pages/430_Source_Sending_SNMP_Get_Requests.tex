\chapter[Source Sending "SNMP Get" Requests]{\underline{Source Sending "SNMP Get" Requests}}
\begin{flushleft}
The following tables list systems that start querying devices via "SNMP Get". While "SNMP Walks" over the entire "SNMP tree" of a device can still create high CPU workload, there is also a security aspect to be considered, as some security devices provide deep insight views to the security configuration. Only authorized servers shall be able to query e.g. firewallâ€™s rule sets or provide an overview of active NIPS signatures. "SNMP Write" is a low risk for security devices like firewalls, as only "SNMP Read" is supported for most of the vendors.
