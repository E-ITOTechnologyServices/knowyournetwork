\chapter[Top 10 Sources by Number of Connections]{\underline{Top 10 Sources by Number of Connections}}
\begin{flushleft}
This table lists the top 10 source IPs by number of initiated connections. A very high number of initiated sessions can lead to problems with a connection table filled up on a server, a firewall or other devices in a network. Also a misconfigured device can show such behavior.
