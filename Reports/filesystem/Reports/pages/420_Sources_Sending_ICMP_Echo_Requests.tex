\chapter[Sources Sending ICMP Echo Requests]{\underline{Sources Sending ICMP Echo Requests}}
\begin{flushleft}
The following tables list systems that start network sweeps by checking the availability of other systems in other networks by sending ICMP echo requests (Ping). These systems might be compromised hosts starting a network reconnaissance to infect other systems replying to the ICMP request. The left table shows the number of pings send from a single system. The right table shows the unique count of destination IP addresses targeted. A high number of packets could be an indicator for a monitoring system, while a high number of destination IP addresses is an indication for a network scan.
