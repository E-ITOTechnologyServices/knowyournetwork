\chapter[GRE Tunnel Detection]{\underline{GRE Tunnel Detection}}
\begin{flushleft}
%
Generic routing encapsulation (GRE) is very often used to link two peer networks which wouldnâ€™t be able to communicate to each other, e.g. over a public network. Within intranets GRE is very often used as a workaround to solve routing and broad-/multicast issues. From security perspective a GRE tunnel is not providing the level of security as the name itself is pretending.
